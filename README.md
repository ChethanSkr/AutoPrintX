AutoPrintX 🖨️🤖 : Smart, Contactless Printing Station 

Theme : Robotics + AI/ML + Cybersecurity


🚀 Overview
AutoPrintX is an intelligent, contactless, and autonomous document printing station designed to revolutionize printing in shared environments like colleges, offices, libraries, and public kiosks. It integrates Robotics, AI/ML, and Cybersecurity to provide a secure, efficient, and scalable printing solution.

🔍 Problem Statement
Current public printing setups are inefficient, rely heavily on human operation and lack secure and automated mechanisms. AutoPrintX addresses this by offering:
Remote document upload.
Secure QR code/RFID-based user authentication.
Robotic paper handling and multi-output dispensing.
Real-time inventory, print queue, and health monitoring.
Scalable architecture for future add-ons like payment gateways and scanning modules.

💡 Key Features

✅ Contactless remote printing with secure authentication.

🤖 Autonomous document handling using robotic mechanisms.

📊 AI-based job queue optimization and failure prediction.

🔧 Real-time diagnostics and predictive maintenance.

♻️ Eco-conscious design with duplex printing and sleep modes.

🧩 Modular structure for scalable deployment.
